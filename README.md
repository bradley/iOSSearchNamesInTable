Searching Names
===========

This simple project shows a searchable table of names. 

In order to provide the best user experience, we make assumptions about
how a user is likely to search for a given name. To this end, we assume
that when looking for a person by name, the user will start with the 
first name. Therefore, we display names alphabetical as much as possible,
while returning results that begin with the search text first. This 
means that Garrett Burnett will appear before Brandon Garrett when 
searching for 'Garrett'.
